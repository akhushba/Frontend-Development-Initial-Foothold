# Frontend-Development-Initial-Foothold

Initial steps taken to create a foundation for HMTL &amp; CSS in order to create my own website.

This repo will hold the progress I've be making towards building up my software development skills, particularily front-end web development.

Mostly, it'll be my initial taste of HTML & CSS through Codecademy and my progress into two Udemy Courses: 

- The HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2023 Edition By Colt Steele
- The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2022) By Colt Steele and Stephen Grider

Ultimately, my goal will be to master the basics and build a solid foundation for HTML, CSS, and Javascript before my next study term begins in September.
